# product\_customer\_owned

Lets you specify that a product is customer-specific or customer-owned.

## Known limitations

This isn't integrated with any other parts of Odoo yet.
It only lets you record who the product is specific to and whether it's owned by
that customer.
The next step is to prevent (or at least warn about) selling customer-specific
products to other customers.
Customer ownership may also need to be reflected when creating procurements for these.
